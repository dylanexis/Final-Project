                <p><strong>Comments:</strong>  Despite this album's shockingly poor Pitchfork rating this album served as a catalyst to the development of my character and a major turning point in my life. That was heavily overexaggerated but pure nostalgia keeps this album in a firm top 20 for me. </p>
