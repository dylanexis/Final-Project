                <p><strong>Comments:</strong> Despite this album's shockingly poor Pitchfork rating, it served as a catalyst to the development of my character and was major turning point in my life. That was heavily overexaggerated, but pure nostalgia keeps this album in a firm top 20 for me and returns to my rotation from time to time. I think that this album accomplished exactly what it wanted and encapsulates the perfect amount of teenage angst. It holds up beautifully what can I say!</p>
