At the Disco,Emo,Electronic,Alternative,Rock,2005,"Despite this album's shockingly poor Pitchfork rating, it served as a catalyst to the development of my character and was major turning point in my life... That was heavily overexaggerated, but pure nostalgia keeps this album in a firm top 20 for me and returns to my rotation from time to time.
