
A Fever You Can't Sweat Out,Panic! At the Disco,Emo,Electronic,Alternative,Rock,2005, Despite this album's shockingly poor Pitchfork rating this album served as a catalyst to the development of my character and a major turning point in my life. That was heavily overexaggerated but pure nostalgia keeps this album in a firm top 20 for me. ,1.5,London Beckoned Songs About Money Written by Machines,panic.jpg,1
